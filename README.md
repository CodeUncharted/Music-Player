Building a Basic MP3 Player with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this project, you'll create a simple yet functional MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to build a web-based music player that allows users to play, pause, skip to the next or previous song, and shuffle the playlist.

The project covers several fundamental concepts in web development, including:

1. Audio Playback: You'll learn how to use the HTML `<audio>` element to handle audio playback, including playing, pausing, and controlling the volume.

2. Playlist Management: You'll create a playlist of songs and implement functionality to move between tracks, either by skipping to the next or previous song, or by shuffling the playlist.

3. User Interface (UI) Interactions**: The project will teach you how to dynamically update the UI based on the current song, such as displaying the song title, artist, and album artwork.

4. Event Handling: You'll learn to handle user interactions, such as clicking the play/pause button, the next/previous buttons, and the shuffle button, and update the player's state accordingly.

5. Time Formatting: You'll implement a feature to display the current playback time and the total duration of the song in a user-friendly format (e.g., minutes:seconds).

By the end of this project, you'll have a working MP3 player that demonstrates your ability to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application. This project is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in building dynamic web experiences and learning fundamental front-end development skills.
